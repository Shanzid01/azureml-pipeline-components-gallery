# Image classification distributed training
![](https://contentmamluswest001.blob.core.windows.net/content/14b2744cf8d6418c87ffddc3f3127242/9502630827244d60a1214f250e3bbca7/f43e79f47d8a4219bf8613d271ea2c45/image?18739520845379465)
## Summary
This is a sample to demonstrate distributed training in azure machine learning. In this pipeline, we use designer built-in modules to do image preprocessing on cpu nodes, and a mpi custom module on distributed gpu nodes.

#### You will learn how to:

1. Using unregistered modules: Load modules from local yaml spec using module SDK.
2. Build pipeline with unregistered modules and AzureML built-in modules.

## Details
The goal of text classification is to assign some piece of text to one or more predefined classes or categories. The piece of text could be a document, news article, search query, email, tweet, support tickets, customer feedback, user product review etc. Applications of text classification include categorizing newspaper articles and news wire contents into topics, organizing web pages into hierarchical categories, filtering spam email, sentiment analysis, predicting user intent from search queries, routing support tickets, and analyzing customer feedback. As part of the Azure Machine Learning offering, Microsoft provides a template to help data scientists easily build and deploy a text classification solution. In this document, you will learn how to use and customize the template through a demo use case.
